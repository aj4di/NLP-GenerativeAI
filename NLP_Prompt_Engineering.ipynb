The software glitches made it virtually unusable, and the constant crashes were infuriating. To add insult to injury, the charging port became faulty within two weeks, costing me an extra $100 for repairs. And guess what? The camera stopped functioning properly, and the repair quote was a shocking $500! I demand an apology for this pitiful excuse of a phone.”\n",
